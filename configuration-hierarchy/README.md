# Configuration Hierarchy Report

This script simplifies the reporting of the configuration hierarchy from HPE Aruba Networking Central using new Central APIs. It retrieves hierarchical dataâ€”including sites, site collections, and devices (note: device groups are not currently supported) and presents it in both a terminal summary table and a CSV file.

By visualizing the configuration hierarchy, network administrators can quickly understand the structure of their Central environment, and locate key attributes such as `scope-id` and `persona`. These attributes are essential for making configuration changes via the New Central APIs.

> [!CAUTION]
> This script uses a beta version of the `pycentral` library and is designed for HPE Aruba New Central, which is also in Public Preview. Expect potential changes and updates to the API and functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- API credentials for HPE Aruba Networking Central (JSON or YAML format)
- There should be atleast 1 site created in the account to get new Central configuration attributes

## Setup

**Clone this repository and `cd` into the workflow directory:**
```bash
git clone -b "v2(pre-release)" https://github.com/aruba/central-python-workflows.git
cd central-python-workflows/configuration-hierarchy
```
**Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
```sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

**Install required packages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Input Files

**Credentials File**: Contains Central API credentials in JSON or YAML format.
Example (YAML):
```yaml
central:
    # Either `base_url` or `cluster_name` should be provided:
    # 
    # base_url: <central-api-base-url>
    # cluster_name: <central-cluster-name>
    client_id: <central-client-id>
    client_secret: <central-client-secret>
```
> [!TIP]
> To obtain your API credentials, please refer to: [Generating and Managing Access Tokens](https://developer.arubanetworks.com/new-central/docs/generating-and-managing-access-tokens) and to locate the `cluster_name`(E.g. **EU-1**) or `base_url`(E.g. **de1.api.central.arubanetworks.com**) of your New Central cluster refer to [API Gateway Base URLs on our Developer Hub](https://developer.arubanetworks.com/new-central/docs/getting-started-with-rest-apis#api-gateway-base-urls).

## Usage

Run the script with the required arguments:

```sh
python hierarchy_report.py -c account_credentials.yaml
```

**Optional arguments:**
- `-o`, `--output-file-name`: Specify the output CSV file name (default: `hierarchy_report.csv`).

Example:
```sh
python hierarchy_report.py -c account_credentials.yaml -o my_hierarchy.csv
```

## Output

- **Terminal Table**: Displays the configuration hierarchy in a formatted table.
- **CSV File**: Saves the hierarchy report to the specified CSV file (default: `hierarchy_report.csv`).
- **Sample Output**: ![Sample Output](configuration_hierarchy.gif)

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your credentials file is valid and in JSON or YAML format.
- Make sure all required dependencies are installed.
